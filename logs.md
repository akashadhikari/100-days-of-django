# 100 Days Of Django - LOG

## Day 0 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic Project Setup
- CRUD action in a blog post.
- Template manipulation.

**Thoughts** : As of now, it takes me about 1 hour to finish all the crud operations using Django Template and Forms. The application I am developing is Medium like clone or a blog social network. Its fun!

**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/akashadhikari/100-days-of-django/commit/fe2438fed82da75cbe8f5f03c9fa14552f31cb6c)

## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic user login and logout
- User authentication.

**Thoughts** : Basic user login is a cool. But maintaining permissions will be more crazier, which I might cover shortly.

## Day 2 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User profile generation
- Media files configuration

**Thoughts** : The idea of user profile initiates a concept of blog social network in this project. Its getting more and more interesting.


## Day 3 : July 12 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User registration frontend and backend.
- Generation of [Profile model objects using Signals](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html) that are triggered during the creation of User model. Cool stuff!

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 4 : July 13 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Registration complete (alert message is remained).
- User Profile maipulation such as - Showing only respective user's content on his/her profile, **Associating post with user** (in view. not model).

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 5 : July 14 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Blog post 'Likes' functionality works like a charm.
- Also added 'Liked by' list view.

**Thoughts** : Maintaining a 'Facebook like' like relationship in our blog was achieved today. I had to deal with a couple of query issues and still some optimization is remained. All in all, it was a hit!
