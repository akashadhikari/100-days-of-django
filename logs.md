# 100 Days Of Django - LOG

## Day 0 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic Project Setup
- CRUD action in a blog post.
- Template manipulation.

**Thoughts** : As of now, it takes me about 1 hour to finish all the crud operations using Django Template and Forms. The application I am developing is Medium like clone or a blog social network. Its fun!

## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic user login and logout
- User authentication.

**Thoughts** : Basic user login is a cool. But maintaining permissions will be more crazier, which I might cover shortly.

## Day 2 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User profile generation
- Media files configuration

**Thoughts** : The idea of user profile initiates a concept of blog social network in this project. Its getting more and more interesting.


## Day 3 : July 12 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User registration frontend and backend.
- Generation of [Profile model objects using Signals](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html) that are triggered during the creation of User model. Cool stuff!

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 4 : July 13 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Registration complete (alert message is remained).
- User Profile maipulation such as - Showing only respective user's content on his/her profile, **Associating post with user** (in view. not model).

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 5 : July 14 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Blog post 'Likes' functionality works like a charm.
- Also added 'Liked by' list view.

**Thoughts** : Maintaining a 'Facebook like' like relationship in our blog was achieved today. I had to deal with a couple of query issues and still some optimization is remained. All in all, it was a hit!


## Day 6 : July 15 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User follow model initiation.
- Conditioning Follow button in the front-end.

**Thoughts** : With blogs/showpieces being generated by each user, it is preferred habit to generate a "follow" feature so that the followers get updated and notified with the feeds.

## Day 7 : July 16 , 2018

**Today I learned** :
- User Follow bug fixes.

**Thoughts** : Honestly, the day was counterproductive. But that's alright. Perhaps, tomorrow is the day to finalize Follow features.

# WEEK 2 STARTS

## Day 8: July 17, 2018

**Today I learned** :
- User Follow feature done.
- User Unfollow feature done.

**Thoughts** : And yes, today was the day! Both follow and unfollow stuff were done. We can move on to some OTHER stuff now! Bear with me.

## Day 9: July 18, 2018

**Today I learned** :
- Minor Bug fixes 

**Thoughts** : Fixing a bug can be an intimidating process. I found that Django was throwing an error while trying to display the the profile to an unauthenticated user. This was later solved. I am not going to fix the 'Follow' and 'Profile' bugs anymore because there ain't none (hopefully). Ok, we will start big things tomorrow.


## Day 10: July 19, 2018

**Today I learned** :
- Case study of School Management System

**Thoughts** : SMS systems can range from a simple application to a complex architecture. Today, I did a small case study on such SMS systems. I will be studying more regarding this system in the days to come.

## Day 11: July 20, 2018

**Today I learned** :
- SMS System design architecture

**Thoughts** : No hands-on code. Only the surfacial study of SMS system was done. Meanwhile, this overall event can come to a halt because of work issues. But, I will try my best to let it not happen.

## Day 12: July 21, 2018

**Today I learned** :
- Various Queryset
- Django + JS Chart basics

**Thoughts** : Some queryset performance was monitored. On the other hand, some study were in JS Chart Frameworks such as HighCharts, d3js, etc.
