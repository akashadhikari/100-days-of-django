# 100 Days Of Django - LOG

## Day 0 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic Project Setup
- CRUD action in a blog post.
- Template manipulation.

**Thoughts** : As of now, it takes me about 1 hour to finish all the crud operations using Django Template and Forms. The application I am developing is Medium like clone or a blog social network. Its fun!

**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/akashadhikari/100-days-of-django/commit/fe2438fed82da75cbe8f5f03c9fa14552f31cb6c)

## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Basic user login and logout
- User authentication.

**Thoughts** : Basic user login is cool. But maintaining permissions will be more crazier, which I might cover shortly.

## Day 2 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User profile generation
- Media files configuration

**Thoughts** : The idea of user profile initiates a concept of blog social network in this project. Its getting more and more interesting.


## Day 3 : July 12 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User registration frontend and backend.
- Generation of [Profile model objects using Signals](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html) that are triggered during the creation of User model. Cool stuff!

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 4 : July 13 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Registration complete (alert message is remained).
- User Profile maipulation such as - Showing only respective user's content on his/her profile, **Associating post with user** (in view. not model).

**Thoughts** : Automatically creating the Profile object during User creation by associating profile with the particular User is a cool concept. The usage of Signal comes vividly here.

## Day 5 : July 14 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- Blog post 'Likes' functionality works like a charm.
- Also added 'Liked by' list view.

**Thoughts** : Maintaining a 'Facebook like' like relationship in our blog was achieved today. I had to deal with a couple of query issues and still some optimization is remained. All in all, it was a hit!


## Day 6 : July 15 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** :
- User follow model initiation.
- Conditioning Follow button in the front-end.

**Thoughts** : With blogs/Snippcode being generated by each user, it is preferred habit to generate a "follow" feature so that the followers get updated and notified with the feeds.

# WEEK 2 STARTS

## Day 7 : July 16 , 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- User Follow bug fixes.

**Thoughts** : Honestly, the day was counterproductive. But that's alright. Perhaps, tomorrow is the day to finalize Follow features.


## Day 8: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- User Follow feature done.
- User Unfollow feature done.

**Thoughts** : And yes, today was the day! Both follow and unfollow stuff were done. We can move on to some OTHER stuff now! Bear with me.

## Day 9: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Minor Bug fixes 

**Thoughts** : Fixing a bug can be an intimidating process. I found that Django was throwing an error while trying to display the the profile to an unauthenticated user. This was later solved. I am not going to fix the 'Follow' and 'Profile' bugs anymore because there ain't none (hopefully). Ok, we will start big things tomorrow.


## Day 10: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Case study of School Management System

**Thoughts** : SMS systems can range from a simple application to a complex architecture. Today, I did a small case study on such SMS systems. I will be studying more regarding this system in the days to come.

## Day 11: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- SMS System design architecture

**Thoughts** : No hands-on code. Only the surfacial study of SMS system was done. Meanwhile, this overall event can come to a halt because of work issues. But, I will try my best to let it not happen.

## Day 12: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Various Queryset
- Django + JS Chart basics

**Thoughts** : Some queryset performance was monitored. On the other hand, some study were in JS Chart Frameworks such as HighCharts, d3js, etc.

## Day 13: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Some miscellaneous frontend layout.

**Thoughts** : Some frontend layout stuff was done.

## No Work Day (14)
** Have some other stuff all day long. Next day will be counted as Day 14 **

# WEEK 3 STARTS

## Day 14: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Minor bug fixes described below

**Thoughts** : Blog author name exception, unique together fields for FollowUser model and Delete user auth check was 
done.

## Day 15: July 25 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Fixed Follow bug resulted by `count()`

**Thoughts** : After following a user, the template was not rendering the Unfollow button and I managed to figure out 
why. Turns out, I wasn't calling the `count` method and setting the condition of returning 1. Some parentheses aren't
just **small**.

## Day 16: July 26 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Tinymce integration
- Code snippet highlight
- Personal CDN

**Thoughts** : Wow! Ok, I have found some known bugs. I also have to make a comment section and other stuff but the
important part was covered (well, at least in Django Admin). Now, the system accepts code/text snippets and highhlights
them according to the language. It's a win!

## Day 17: July 27 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Add snippet from form (raw code)
- Jaqen H'gar mode: Guest user : No one!
- Enhance profile info.

**Thoughts** : I included snippet pasting feature from the frontend but with the raw code (no wysiwyg). Also, the feature of "guest user" or Jaqen H'gar mode was included :laughing: . Lastly, some enhancement on profile info (total snipps count, likes count etc) to wrap it up for today.

## Day 18: July 28 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Page hits counter
- Individual profile based snipp hits view count (use of annotation)
- Searching according to title, description and code.

**Thoughts** : Done some cool things like Page hits counter (based on session) and searching (based on snipp title, description and code).

## Day 19: July 29 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Comments on the post
- Code snippet info on modal
- Form validations
- Add footer and manage layouts.

**Thoughts** : One of the most important tasks has been achieved. The functionality of adding user comments is done.
User can also paste the snippet in the comment. Also, a help-modal was generated for snippet help. The historic task of
adding footer was also done. :p

## Day 20: July 30 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Massive changes on home page UI.
- Other minor front-end fixes.

**Thoughts** : Lots of changes have been made on the home page. First of all, the list view is placed to a right column as most of the priority is given to the **Add Quick Snippet** feature. The UI looks much better.

# WEEK 4 STARTS

## Day 21: July 31 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Navbar layot changes.
- Trending list and Recent list added in the right col.

**Thoughts** : The task of showing trending list (last week's most viewed pastes/snippets) and the most recent paste was accomplished. Some other tweaks were made in the frontend. Its beginning to look a lot cooler.

## Day 22: August 1 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Following list post template
- Comment delete template

**Thoughts** : Not much things happened besides setting up the apropriate templates for following feed and delete comment.
Still a long way to go and today was certainly not the day full of pace and deliverance.

## Day 23: August 2 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Add private snippet feature and massive manipulations on them.
- Form condition: Hide one of the form field to guest users.

**Thoughts** : What a day! First of all, I implemented the private snippet creating option (Just because of this feature, snippet sharing application goes Pro :grin: ). And then, the restriction was set to the guest user from django form!

## Day 24: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Navbar top fixed.
- Select related Django ORM.

**Thoughts** : Some focus on front-end with navbar being fixed upon scroll. Also, I was working with select related queries for following users. Work is going on.

## Day 25: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Profile Edit form.
- User snippet edit permission fix.

**Thoughts** : A mandatory feature of profile edit was done. In the meantime, I was unaware about the fact that I had't
set any permissions for the users who were trying to sneak into editing someone else's post. This is done now.

## Day 26: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Media cdn configurations.
- Frontend fixes.

**Thoughts** :Of course, it's always wise to store media (and static) to a separate CDN. This is a test where I have kept the cdn within the project directory for simplicity but the basic idea is understandable.

**Today's Progress** :

- Some works on date picker input. (not integrated)

**Thoughts** : The goal of [Talk to u later](https://github.com/akashadhikari/talk-to-u-later) is to create scheduled tasks. Thus, the date-field input needs to be user friendly and workable. Not much of progress was made besides including that form field.

## Day off (August 8) (This is a serious violation of continuity.)
